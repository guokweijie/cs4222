## Task 1
- Value of CLOCK_SECOND: 128
- Number of clock ticks per second for etimer: 128
- Value of RTIMER_SECOND: 65536
- Number of clock ticks per second for rtimer: 65574

## Instructions for executing program:
Under the `./build/cc26x0-cc13x0/sensortag/cc2650/` folder, you can find the two executables for `task2` and `task3`. Load them into the sensortag using UniFlash to run the programs.

To simulate movement, use your hands to move the device around rapidly. To simulate light changes, you can use the torchlight from your mobile phone, slowing moving closer to the device, and then move away quickly to simulate a rapid change in light intensity. Note that the light sensor is on the **underside** of the device (opposite of the reset button).
